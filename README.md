## AI Text Analyzer

A comprehensive web-based text analysis tool that implements real AI algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyze text content. This practical implementation provides sentiment analysis, readability scoring, keyword extraction, and automatic summarization.

##  Features

### Core Analysis Tools

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses lexicon-based analysis to determine emotional tone and sentiment polarity
- **Text Statistics**: Comprehensive metrics including word count, sentence count, character count, and reading time
- **Keyword Extraction**: Implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to identify important keywords
- **Text Summarization**: Extractive summarization using sentence scoring based on word frequency and position analysis
- **Readability Scoring**: Implements Flesch-Kincaid readability algorithm with visual progress indicators

### User Interface

- **Modern Design**: Glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-friendly design that works across all devices
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, loading animations, and smooth transitions
- **Real-time Processing**: Visual loading indicators with processing simulation
- **Color-coded Results**: Sentiment results with appropriate color coding (positive/negative/neutral)

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional software or dependencies required

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-text-analyzer
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
   - Or simply double-click the `index.html` file

##  Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Enter Text**: Paste or type your text in the input textarea
2. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze Text" button
3. **View Results**: Review the comprehensive analysis results including:
   - Text statistics (words, sentences, characters, reading time)
   - Sentiment analysis with polarity scoring
   - Readability score with difficulty level
   - Top keywords extracted using TF-IDF
   - AI-generated summary

### Sample Analysis

The application comes with pre-loaded sample text about artificial intelligence that demonstrates all features. You can:
- Replace it with your own content
- Use it to understand the analysis capabilities
- Test different types of text (news articles, reviews, academic papers, etc.)

### Use Cases

- **Content Writers**: Analyze readability and sentiment of articles
- **Social Media Managers**: Check sentiment of posts and comments
- **Students**: Analyze academic papers and essays
- **Researchers**: Extract keywords and summarize documents
- **Marketers**: Analyze customer feedback and reviews

##  Customization

### Styling

The application uses CSS custom properties and can be easily customized:

```css
/* Main color scheme */
--primary-color: #5a67d8;
--secondary-color: #667eea;
--accent-color: #764ba2;

/* Modify gradients */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Algorithm Parameters

You can modify algorithm behavior by adjusting parameters:

```javascript
// Sentiment lexicon - add more words
const sentimentLexicon = {
    positive: ['good', 'great', /* add more */],
    negative: ['bad', 'terrible', /* add more */]
};

// Reading time calculation (words per minute)
const readingTime = Math.ceil(wordCount / 200); // Adjust 200 to your preference

// Summary length (number of sentences)
.slice(0, 2) // Change 2 to desired number of sentences
```
